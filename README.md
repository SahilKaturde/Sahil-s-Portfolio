# Sahil’s Portfolio (React)

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React**.  
The site supports both **Marathi and English**, includes multiple tabs, and uses a **dual-angle page layout** to present bilingual content clearly and professionally.

## 🛠 Backend Information

I have created a full backend using **Django**, including setups for APIs and data handling.  
However, I **did not include the backend** in this repository.

### Why it’s not included?
As a student, I currently have some financial constraints and expenses.  
Hosting or deploying the backend would require extra cost and management, which I’m not able to cover right now.  
So for the moment, this project includes only the frontend React code.

In the future, I plan to integrate the Django backend fully once I have the resources.
