# Sahil’s Portfolio (React Native)

This repository contains my personal mobile portfolio application built using **React Native**.  
The app supports **Marathi and English**, includes multiple tabs for navigation, and features a unique **dual-angle page** layout to display content in both languages clearly.

## 🚀 Features

- **Built with React Native** for cross-platform compatibility  
- **Dual Language Support** – Marathi & English  
- **Multiple Tabs** for better navigation (About, Projects, Blog, etc.)  
- **Clean UI** designed for readability  
- **Dual-angle page** to present bilingual content side-by-side  
- **Screenshot previews** included

## 🛠 Backend Information (Important)

I have created a **complete Django backend setup** for the portfolio, but I did **not include it here**.

**Reason:**  
As a student, I currently have financial constraints and some personal expenses, so I cannot host or maintain the backend right now. However, I have included some backend-related code for future integration.

Once I am able to manage hosting costs and time, I will **integrate the Django backend fully** and update the project.
