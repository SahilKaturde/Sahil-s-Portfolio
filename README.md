# Sahil’s Portfolio (React)

This repository contains my personal portfolio application built using **React**.  
The site supports **Marathi and English**, includes multiple tabs for navigation, and features a unique **dual-angle page** layout to display content in both languages clearly.

## 🛠 Backend Information (Important)

I have created a **complete Django backend setup** for this portfolio, but I did **not include it here**.

**Reason:**  
As a student, I currently have financial constraints and some personal expenses, so I cannot host or maintain the backend right now.  
However, I have added some backend-related code that will be integrated in the future once hosting becomes possible.

When my budget allows, I will **add and deploy the full Django backend**.
